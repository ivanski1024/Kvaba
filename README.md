Ok. I got it!

There should be couple of things

The "BOT" which should act as a middle man between the "Client" and the "Server"
He should be able to visualize the buttons for the 4 crypto currencies.

The "SERVER" which should be listining for requests, and should be able to communicate with some third-party "Crypto service", to get the information required.

The "DATABASE", where we store the valuable information, for example who is subscribed for what, and maybe log of the previous prices, although this information should be easy to access from the "Crytpo Service"

Proper separation should be developed in the codebase.

I will commit this with hopes that this helps me.

The current state of the code does NOT apply the statements above. (hopefully the next one will)

PS: Better to be late then never! :)

PPS: And I should commit more often!
